### Hi there!

I'm National Manager IT Strategy & Productisation [AUCloud](https://australiacloud.com.au).



My background is as an applied researcher who stumbled into the world of software  via MATLAB and Fortran.
I have a masochistic streak which draws me to problems where business/mission complexity requires innovative solutions.
If those solutions have an element of supporting good governance even better!

Today my primary focus is on building and improving the service portfolio (e.g. PaaS and SaaS services) at AUCloud.

In my open source life I work on [compliance-trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle).
Otherwise find me professionally on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjbutler/).
