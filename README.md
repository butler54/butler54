### Hi there!

I'm Head of Platforms for [AUCloud](https://australiacloud.com.au).


My backgroun is as an applied researcher who stumbled into the world of development via MATLAB and Fortran.
I have a masochistic streak which draws me to problems where business/mission complexity requires innovative solutions.
If those solutions have an element of supporting good governance even better!

In my open source life I work on [compliance-trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle).
Otherwise find me professionally on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjbutler/) or personally (however infrequently) [here](https://chrisbutlerphotos.com/).
