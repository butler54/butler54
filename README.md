### Hi there!

I'm a applied researcher who stumbled into the world of development via MATLAB and Fortran.
I have a masochistic streak which draws me to problems where business/mission complexity requires innovative solutions.
If those solutions have an element of supporting good governance even better!

I'm currently working on [compliance-trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle) together with a small team.
If you are interested in trestle [reach out](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle/issues/new/choose).

Otherwise find me professionally on [linkedin](<>) or personally (however infrequently) [here](https://chrisbutlerphotos.com/).
