### Hi there!

I'm a Chief Archtect at [Red Hat](https://redhat.com) working in the Asia Pacific CTO Office.




My background is as an applied researcher who stumbled into the world of software  via MATLAB and Fortran.
I have a masochistic streak which draws me to problems where business/mission complexity requires innovative solutions.
If those solutions have an element of supporting good governance even better!

Today I'm refining my mission at Red Hat. Interesting things I've been working on so far include:

- GPUaaS infrastructures with partners
- Digital Sovereignity including modern cloud infrastructure patterns
- Enabling AI stacks in a variety of circumstances.
- Security and Compliance in the complexity of the environments above.

If any of this sounds interesting please checkout my [blog](https://chris.thebutlers.me/blog/) or reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherjbutler/).
